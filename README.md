# Flymake-Quickdef
Quickly define a new [Flymake][flymake] backend

This package mainly defines `flymake-quickdef-backend`, a macro which
helps remove some of the boilerplate code from defining new Flymake
backend functions. The macro defines a function that is suitable to
register with Flymake and is similar in implementation to the
[example][example] in the Flymake manual.

New backend functions using the macro provide:

1. A Lisp form producing command line arguments for a program
2. A regular expression to search the process output
3. A Lisp form to convert the regex matches into Flymake diagnostics

The process of spawning the process and maintaining temporary files
and buffers is generated by the macro. The macro definitions work
similarly to [Flycheck's macro][fly-checker]. This makes it easier to
define Flymake diagnostics using external linters and other programs.
