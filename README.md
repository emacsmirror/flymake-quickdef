# Flymake-Quickdef
Quickly define a new [Flymake][flymake] backend

This package mainly defines `flymake-quickdef-backend`, a macro which
helps remove some of the boilerplate code from defining new Flymake
backend functions. The macro defines a function that is suitable to
register with Flymake and is similar in implementation to the
[example][example] in the Flymake manual.

New backend functions using the macro provide, minimally:

1. A Lisp form producing command line arguments for a program
2. A regular expression to search the process output
3. A Lisp form to convert the regex matches into Flymake diagnostics

The process of spawning the process and maintaining temporary files
and buffers is generated by the macro. The macro definitions work
similarly to [Flycheck's macro][fly-checker]. This makes it easier to
define Flymake diagnostics using external linters and other programs.

## Usage
A basic diagnostic function to check Python source code using
[Bandit][bandit] can be produced using the macro. The generated
backend function handles inserting the current buffer's contents into
a temporary file and running the external process.

```elisp
(flymake-quickdef-backend flymake-check-bandit
  :pre-let ((bandit-exec (executable-find "bandit")))
  :pre-check (unless bandit-exec (error "Cannot find bandit executable"))
  :write-type 'file
  :proc-form (list bandit-exec "--format" "custom" "--msg-template" "diag:{line} {severity} {test_id}: {msg}" fmqd-temp-file)
  :search-regexp "^diag:\\([[:digit:]]+\\) \\(HIGH\\|LOW\\|MEDIUM\\|UNDEFINED\\) \\([[:alpha:]][[:digit:]]+\\): \\(.*\\)$"
  :prep-diagnostic
  (let* ((lnum (string-to-number (match-string 1)))
         (severity (match-string 2))
         (code (match-string 3))
         (text (match-string 4))
         (pos (flymake-diag-region fmqd-source lnum))
         (beg (car pos))
         (end (cdr pos))
         (type (cond
                ((string= severity "HIGH") :error)
                ((string= severity "MEDIUM") :warning)
                (t :note)))
         (msg (format "%s (%s)" text code)))
    (list fmqd-source beg end type msg)))
```

Once the backend is defined, just arrange for it to be added to
`flymake-diagnostic-functions`, for example in a mode hook.
