;; Flymake backend definition macro and support

(defvar-local flymake-quickdef--procs nil
  "Internal variable used by `flymake-quickdef-backend'.
Do not edit its value. This variable holds a plist used to store
handles to running processes for Flymake backends. Entries are
keyed by the symbol name of the appropriate backend function and
values are running processes.")

(defmacro flymake-quickdef-backend (name &optional docstring &rest plist)
  "Quickly define a backend for use with Flymake.
This macro produces a new function, NAME, which is suitable to
insert into `flymake-diagnostic-functions'. The function will
have documentation as specified in the mandatory DOCSTRING. The
body of the function will be generated based on the forms passed
in through DEF-PLIST as documented below.

The plist is keyed by several keyword arguments: \":pre-let\",
\":pre-check\", \":write-type\", \":proc-form\",
\":search-regexp\", and \":prep-diagnostic\".

The forms passed to this macro may also make use of several
special variables: \"source\" and \"temp-file\". The variable
\"source\" stores a reference to the buffer containing the text
to check with Flymake. It is initialized to `current-buffer' at
the beginning of evaluation. The variable \"temp-file\" is
defined when :write-type is 'file. It contains the path of the
temporary file which was created for the current backend run.

The implementation of this macro is derived from Flymake manual.
See info node `(flymake)An annotated example backend'."
